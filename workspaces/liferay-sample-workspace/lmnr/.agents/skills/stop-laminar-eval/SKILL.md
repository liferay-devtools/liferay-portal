# Stop Laminar Eval

Take down what `run-laminar-eval` brought up, in reverse: the Liferay server first, then Laminar.

## When to Invoke

- The user asks to stop, shut down, or clean up the eval stack.
- The user is done with a run and wants the ports and memory back.

Both steps are no-ops when the target is already down, so the skill is safe to run against a partly stopped stack.

## Workflow

### Stop the Liferay Server

From the workspace root:

```bash
blade server stop
```

When no Tomcat JVM process is running, there is nothing to do — skip to Laminar. Otherwise, wait for the process to actually exit; the command can return before the JVM is gone. Confirm by checking that the process is absent and that port 8080 no longer answers:

```bash
curl --output /dev/null --silent --write-out '%{http_code}' http://localhost:8080
```

`bundles/` itself is left in place. `run-laminar-eval` clears `bundles/data` and `bundles/logs` on the next start.

### Tear Down Laminar

**Confirm with the user before running this — it destroys data.** `--volumes` deletes the stack's Postgres and ClickHouse volumes, so every recorded trace and eval run is gone for good. Offer plain `docker compose down` as the alternative when they want the history kept; it stops the containers and leaves the volumes.

```bash
cd lmnr/compose && docker compose down --volumes
```

Losing the volumes costs history only, not the ability to run again: the Laminar workspace, project, and API key are recreated on the next run, because `lmnr/evals/lib/bootstrap.ts` mints them at import time.

Verify nothing is left running:

```bash
docker compose ps
```
